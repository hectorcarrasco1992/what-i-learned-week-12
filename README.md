 # Events week

``` 
My biggest take away from this week was that event.target is a hard concept to grasp for me.

* we made a game that would take objects with defined health and damage vales, and made them fight.
* the trick with this is using event listeners and understanding how to use classLists.

# Math is hard

* in this project we made a dice app.

* We had to find the mean mode and median for each.
* the math was truly the hardest and really held me up.
